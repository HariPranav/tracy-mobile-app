## Description of Project

An app for contact tracing, safe movement and digitally enabling government, citizens, and medical professionals on top MoiBit for privately and securely using location data. Tracy is an attempt to create an 'anxiety free' and ‘risk-mitigated’ movement for global citizens using digital with privacy.

Tracy addresses privacy concerns by allowing people to safely and confidently share information without compromising privacy.  The medical teams / task forces get access to location data that is stripped of PII (personal identifier information) and can apply business rules to intervene in specific cases. There is a data broker service that masks personal information and helps target affected users accurately without compromising privacy.

Tracy uses data sciences on top of decentralized private data store, to enable intelligent enforcement between government and citizens, reduce the social anxiety, and increase economic activity with targeted/private health support.
